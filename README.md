# NLP_Assignment_2_Naive_Bayes

## Project Overview

This project is part of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) assignments for the SIIT course. The focus of this assignment is to implement the Naive Bayes classifier for sentiment analysis on a dataset of tweets. The primary objective is to predict whether a tweet expresses a positive or negative sentiment based on the text content.

## Key Features

- **Naive Bayes Classifier:** A probabilistic model that uses Bayes' Theorem to predict the sentiment of tweets.
- **Text Preprocessing:** Includes techniques like tokenization, stop-word removal, and word frequency calculation.
- **Feature Extraction:** Extracts relevant features from the tweets to be used by the Naive Bayes classifier.
- **Model Training and Testing:** The classifier is trained on a labeled dataset of tweets and tested on a separate validation set.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Includes accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the performance of the model.

## Project Structure

- **Dataset:** Contains the tweet dataset used for training and testing the model.
- **Preprocessing:** Scripts for preprocessing the tweet text, including tokenization and feature extraction.
- **Model Implementation:** Code for implementing the Naive Bayes classifier from scratch.
- **Evaluation:** Scripts for evaluating the model's performance using various metrics.

## How to Use

1. **Install Dependencies:** Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed. You can install the necessary packages using `requirements.txt` (if provided).
